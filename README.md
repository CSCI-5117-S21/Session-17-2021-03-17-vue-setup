# Sesssion 17. A (nearly) default status project.

Changelog:

1. I've changed this readme file very slightly.
2. I've modified the basic file setup to be 1) worse, 2) better at demonstrating "binding"

## Project setup (Do once after checkout)
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development (development server)
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production (SPA is _technically_ a static file website. This builds that)
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>(for more info on what that means)
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
